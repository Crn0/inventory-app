                "The Sefirah Castle , previously called the mysterious space above the Gray Fog before Klein Moretti (Zhou Mingrui) knew its name[1] and is also called The Door of Light, is one of the nine Sefirot on Earth, a legacy left behind by the Original Creator and originally owned by The Celestial Worthy of Heaven and Earth. Corresponds to one of the Three Pillars, Lord of the Mysteries Group. The Demonic Wolf Flegrea knew its name and tried to get in it in \"His\" entire life through the Fool Pathway but never succeeded. Therefore, many powerful creatures suspect that the Sefirah Castle doesn't exist and is only an abstract concept. Klein is able to go above the gray fog through a certain ritual he had learned when he was still in 21st century China. In the Sefirah Castle, Klein holds regular Tarot Club meetings where he poses as Mr. Fool. Once stable, the Sefirah Castle's core appears as a strange door of light mark on humanoid Klein's glabella",
